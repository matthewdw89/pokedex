# Pokedex

Creating a quick pokedex using [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Pok√©mon API](https://pokeapi.co/)

Currently the API does not return sprites. Looking at alternative options to have in the Pokemon List
 **option one**
  - Due to sprites not being present in the pokemon API on a list request, I will be addding my own api to use in this project
